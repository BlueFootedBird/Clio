# Security Features

Clio implements multiple layers of security to protect sensitive red team operation data. This document outlines the key security features implemented throughout the application.

## Authentication Security

### Password Security
- **Strong Password Policy**:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Must include uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Must include numbers
  - Must include special characters
  - Cannot be just letters followed by numbers
  - Cannot contain repeated characters (3 or more times)

- **Password Hashing**: 
  - Implemented using PBKDF2 with 310,000 iterations
  - 32-byte cryptographically secure salt per password
  - SHA-256 hash function

- **First Login Password Change**:
  - Users must change their password on first login
  - Temporary passwords expire after first use

### Session Management

- **JWT-based Authentication**:
  - Signed JSON Web Tokens
  - Automatic refresh for tokens approaching expiration
  - Server instance verification to prevent token reuse across deployments

- **Redis-backed Session Store**:
  - Sessions encrypted using AES-256-GCM
  - 8-hour session duration
  - Server-side session validation
  - Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

- **Admin Session Controls**:
  - Force logout capabilities for all sessions
  - Active session monitoring and management
  - Session revocation for compromised accounts

## API Security

- **API Key Authentication**:
  - Secure API key generation with prefix and secret
  - Key hash verification (only hashes stored in database)
  - Per-key permission system with fine-grained access control
  - Automatic key rotation capabilities
  - Key expiration settings
  - Usage auditing and tracking

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Per-API key rate limiting to prevent abuse
  - Configurable limits for different endpoints
  - Automatic throttling for suspicious activity

## Transport Security

- **TLS Encryption**:
  - End-to-end encryption for all service communications
  - Strong cipher suites and TLS 1.2+ only
  - Self-signed or custom certificates with automatic setup
  - Perfect forward secrecy for all connections

- **Secure Headers**:
  - Implemented via Helmet.js
  - Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
  - Referrer-Policy enforcement

## Data Security

- **Input Sanitization and Validation**:
  - All user inputs sanitized to prevent injection attacks
  - Field-specific validation and sanitization rules
  - Protection against common injection patterns

- **CSRF Protection**:
  - Unique CSRF tokens for each session
  - Double-submit cookie pattern
  - Token validation for all state-changing operations
  - CSRF bypass protection for API requests with separate authentication

- **Storage Security**:
  - Redis data encrypted at rest
  - PostgreSQL data persistence with volume isolation
  - Evidence file protection with hash verification

## Logging and Auditing

- **Comprehensive Event Logging**:
  - All security events recorded
  - Authentication attempts tracked
  - API key usage logged
  - Admin actions audited
  - Log rotation and retention policies

- **Sensitive Data Handling**:
  - Automatic redaction of sensitive information in logs
  - Secrets management and protection
  - Secure display and masking in UI

## Secure Development Practices

- **Container Security**:
  - Updated base images with security patches
  - Minimal container permissions
  - Internal network isolation
  - No unnecessary exposed ports

- **Dependency Management**:
  - Regular updates for all dependencies
  - Vulnerability scanning integration
  - Patch management process
